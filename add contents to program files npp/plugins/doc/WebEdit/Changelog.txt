- Added "\c" escape sequence to paste clipboard contents when replacing a tag.
- Added "\i" escape sequence to increase indentation level when replacing a tag.
- Removed error message box from the "Edit Config" command.
- Fixed: "\n" now indents by copying only the empty part of the first line, not the whole part up to the tag.
- Fixed invalid caret placement after replacing a tag when you move the caret with up and down keys (it jumped to a different column on adjacent lines).

- Added version number to the About box title.

Version 1.4, 23.02.2010.

Version 1.3.1, 11.07.2008.
- Tab character does not terminate a line in the ini-file anymore.

Version 1.3, 09.07.2008.
- The plugin can be configured to add its commands to the toolbar.

Version 1.2, 18.06.2008.
- New feature for Notepad++ 5.0 and later: the Shortcut Mapper will show the
  actual menu item names instead of dummy "WebEdit XX", e.g. "WebEdit -
  Paragraph Tag".
  Note: to update strings displayed by the Shortcut Mapper you have to restart
  Notepad++. If you have used "Load Config" to update the plugin configuration,
  the shortcut table may be out of date.

Version 1.1, 07.06.2008.
- The dummy menu entries are renamed from "not used" to "WebEdit Slot XX", where
  XX is the number of the slot. This helps greatly to find the items in the Shortcut
  Mapper and differentiate between them.

- Added version information resource to the DLL.
